# hypothesis-testing-Multi-way-ANOVA

The Project performs a 3- way ANOVA to determine the significance of weight loss by 3 different diet plans. The data set is available publicly on the University of Sheffield webpage. The dataset contains physical measurements(height,weight,age etc) of 79 people who underwent these 3 diet plans and their weight after 6 weeks was noted. We find the most significant factors and perform ANOVA to check if true averages of these diet plans are equal(Null Hypothesis). We also perform an OLS Regression model to fit our data for future testing.
